= MSMQ Connector User Guide
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connector, endpoint, msmq, microsoft, message queuing

The Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) connector uses a typical client-server architecture with two tiers, the connector or client running in the Mule ESB, and the Windows Gateway running on the server side. The latter exposes an HTTP Web API for sending or receiving messages from MSMQ.

[WARNING]
*Important*: Install the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/windows-gateway-services-guide[Windows Gateway Service] first before installing and configuring MSMQ.

The following is a high-level diagram of the solution architecture:

image:WindowsGateway.png[WindowsGateway]

For more information, see the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/windows-gateway-services-guide[Windows Gateway Services Guide].

== Invalid Message Processing

Unreadable messages are moved to the `invalid-queue-name` subqueue. You can change this queue’s name using the Windows Gateway service configuration file. You can also change the timeout for invalid messages for when a payload of a message is parsed with an incorrect formatter.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<!-- The name of the invalid messages sub-queue -->
<add key="invalid-queue-name" value="Invalid"/>

<!-- Time in seconds for invalid messages before being sent to dead-letter queue -->
<add key="invalid-message-timeout" value="86400"/>
----

=== Enable Exactly-Once and In-Order Support

To enable Exactly-Once and In-Order (EOIO) support, you must select the flow containing the MSMQ connector in Anypoint Studio and set the default operation *Processing Strategy* to `synchronous`. Otherwise, the connector processes messages as they are received in the ESB and ignores the original order in the queue.

image:FlowConfiguration.png[FlowConfiguration]

This setting appears in the XML as:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<flow name="myMSMQFlow" doc:name="myMSMQFlow" processingStrategy="synchronous">
----

== Primary Use Cases

The MSMQ connector supports two primary use cases:

* Sends (HTTP POST) a single message to MSMQ
* Receives (HTTP GET) one or more messages from MSMQ

=== HTTP POST Scenario

In the POST scenario, Mule ESB uses the connector to send a raw representation of the Mule Message in the current flow to MSMQ using HTTP to the Windows Gateway. The message is sent as an HTTP POST. The payload of the HTTP request is the serialized payload of the Mule message (binary or text). The Web API runs on the Windows Gateway and forwards the message to a queue using MSMQ.

The following messages show the structure of the HTTP POST request.

==== POST Request Message

[source, code, linenums]
----
POST: https://localhost:9333/msmq
Authorization: mule test-token
Mule-Msmq-Queue-Name: .\private$\qout
Mule-Api-Version: 1
Body: THIS IS A SAMPLE MESSAGE
----

POST Response Message

[source, code, linenums]
----
Http /1.1 201 Created
----

=== HTTP GET Scenario

In the GET scenario, Mule ESB uses the connector to receive one or more messages from MSMQ. This is done as an HTTP GET to the Windows Gateway. The Web API runs in the gateway and returns the available messages in a MSMQ queue. The messages are returned in a single HTTP response using a MIME `multipart/mixed` content type.

The following messages illustrate the structure of the HTTP GET request.

==== GET Request Message

[source, code, linenums]
----
GET: https://localhost:9333/msmq?count=50
Authorization: mule test-token
Mule-Msmq-Queue-Name: .\private$\out

The HTTP headers used for sending and receiving messages to and from the Gateway service are discussed more in detail later in this document.

== Two-Phase Commit

The MSMQ connector uses a two-phase protocol to ensure zero-message-loss communication with the gateway.

In a traditional scenario, after a message is read in the gateway, it is deleted from the queue. If there is a connection failure or another issue in the ESB that prevents the message from being read, that message is lost.

In a scenario with a two-phase commit protocol, the messages read from the main queue are kept in a sub-queue as backup. After the connector receives a copy of the message, it sends an additional request to the gateway to remove the message from the sub-queue. When this commit action is not completed, the message remains in the sub-queue. After a period of time, messages in the subqueue, considered as orphans, are moved back to their parent queue where they are retried. To be clear, this mechanism should not be affected by external exceptions happening in the flow unless the execution is interrupted before the commit action is completed. Developers should not assume this will be always the case for any exception happening in the running flow.    

== Message Timeouts

Among different methods, MSMQ messages provide two properties that are useful to grant reliability of information:

* *timeToReachQueue*. The maximum number of seconds a message can take to reach the MSMQ server after it's received in the gateway. The default is to not time out (InfiniteTimeout).
* *timeToBeReceived*. The number of seconds a message can stay in the queue before it dequeues for a third party application. The default is to not time out (InfiniteTimeout).

image:MSMQmessageTimeouts2.png[MSMQmessageTimeouts2]

[NOTE]
If either property times out, the message moves to the dead-letter queue.

Specifying values for the properties:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<msmq:send
    config-ref="MSMQ"
    messageFormatter="ActiveXMessageFormatter"
    doc:name="MSMQ"
    timeToBeReceived="0"
    timeToReachQueue="0" />
----

Both properties can be set in the connector configuration and are read by the Windows Gateway. If you specify a value of zero (0), the default value is assumed (InfiniteTimeout).

== Security Considerations

The authentication of the MSMQ connector is handled by a security token included in the HTTP Authorization header. This token is included on every HTTP request to the Gateway using the Mule scheme:

[source, code, linenums]
----
GET: https://localhost:9333/msmq?count=50
Authorization: mule test-token
Mule-Msmq-Queue-Name: .\private$\out
Mule-Api-Version: 1
----

Configure the token on the connector and also in the Gateway configuration file. The following shows how the token is configured on both sides:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<msmq:config name="MSMQ" doc:name="MSMQ" accessToken="test-token" rootQueueName=".\private$\qout" serviceAddress="localhost:9333">
 <msmq:connection-pooling-profile initialisationPolicy="INITIALISE_ONE" exhaustedAction="WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW"/>
 </msmq:config>
----

=== User Authentication

The user executing the call on behalf of the connector is authenticated through two custom HTTP headers, `mule-impersonate-username` and `mule-impersonate-password`. 

When using user authentication, the queue in MSMQ must also be marked to require authentication. These two headers represent the Windows credentials of an existing user in the Active Directory forest where the Windows Gateway service is running, or a local account on the machine hosting the service. When these HTTP headers are included in an HTTP Request, the Windows Gateway service authenticates and impersonates this user before queuing / dequeuing a message from MSMQ. This provides the ability to configure the correct access control list permissions on the queue using Windows credentials.

The following HTTP request example illustrates how to pass these two headers from the connector to the Gateway:

[source, code, linenums]
----
GET: https://localhost:9333/msmq?count=50
Authorization: mule test-token
Mule-Impersonate-Username: domain\myuser
Mule-Impersonate-Password: password
Mule-Msmq-Queue-Name: .\private$\out
Mule-Api-Version: 1
----

*Note*: The connector and the gateway use SSL to protect all the HTTP communications.

=== Queue Permissions

To use queue permissions, mark the queue to require authentication. In addition, the connector must send the `Mule-Impersonate-Username` and `Mule-Impersonate-Password` headers in the HTTP request message to impersonate the call; otherwise the account impersonating the host is used (the user impersonating the Windows service or the application pool if the gateway is hosted in IIS).

*Note*: A Windows user must have logged in for at least the first time before using authenticated queues. When a user logs in for the first time, Windows creates a user's profile, which must exist for the user to use authenticated queues.

The following table shows the permissions required for sending or receiving a message from a queue:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Operation* |*Permissions*
|*Receive* |Receive Message, Peek Message
|*Send* |Send Message, Peek Message, Get Properties
|===

In both cases, Peek Message is only used for testing the connection. This permission can be removed if testing the connection is not required.

*Note*: When MSMQ is installed in a machine not joined to a Windows Domain, it works in Workgroup Mode. In this mode, authenticated queues are not supported and therefore the queue permissions can not be used either.

== Message Serialization and Formatting

The Windows Gateway service does not use an MSMQ formatter unless it is specified by the connector. Therefore, a message sent in the HTTP request payload is stored in raw form in the body of the MSMQ message. However, this behavior can be overridden by setting a Message Formatter in the connector. A single formatter is supported out of the box: `ActiveXMessageFormatter`.

The following example illustrates how to set the formatter in an MSMQ connector:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<msmq:receive config-ref="MSMQ" doc:name="MSMQ (Streaming)" pollingPeriod="3000" messageFormatter="ActiveXMessageFormatter" />
----

When a message formatter is set on the connector, an additional HTTP header `Mule-Msmq-Formatter` is sent to the Windows Gateway. The gateway uses that formatter to serialize and deserialize the message when it enqueues or dequeues from MSMQ.

For the ActiveXMessageFormatter, the gateway also uses the Content-Type set by the connector in the HTTP request message:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Content-Type |Description
|` plain/text ` |The connector sets this when the payload of the current Mule Message is a string. When set, the gateway sets the body stream of the MSMQ message as a string. Other applications can read this message directly as a string. An MSMQ connector receiving this message sets the payload of the Mule Message to a string so that a converter is not required.
|`application/octet-stream` |Set when the payload is a byte array. The message is stored as a stream of bytes.
|===

=== Configuration of the msmq:receive Element

The `msmq:receive` element is used in the primary scenario for receiving one or more messages from the Gateway.

This following table shows the properties in this element:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Property* |*Usage*
|*queueName* |Queue name in UNC path or FormatName notation. See the link:https://docs.google.com/a/mulesoft.com/document/d/1mUBv_Cdz1DDzdYgVHBy4cpXkvtdh1kwa3s4dLkjBEiM/edit#heading=h.4rg6xwxl7scj[Queue Names] section for more information. Overrides the queue name set in the Global element. Optional.
|*pollingPeriod* |Interval in milliseconds used by the connector for polling the configured queue in MSMQ. Optional.
|*messageCount* |Maximum number of messages to retrieve in a single batch. Optional.
|*userName* |The name of the user that is used to impersonate the call when accessing MSMQ from the Gateway. Overrides the user name set in the Global element. Optional.
|*password* |The password of the user that will be used to impersonate the call when accessing MSMQ from the Gateway. Overrides the password set in the Global element. Optional.
|*messageFormatter* |The message formatter to be used in MSMQ for serializing and deserializing the message. Optional.
|===

=== Configuration of the msmq:send Element

The `msmq:send` element is used in the primary scenario for sending one message to the Gateway.

This following table shows the properties in this element:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Property* |*Usage*
|*queueName* |Queue name in UNC path or FormatName notation. See the link:https://docs.google.com/a/mulesoft.com/document/d/1mUBv_Cdz1DDzdYgVHBy4cpXkvtdh1kwa3s4dLkjBEiM/edit#heading=h.4rg6xwxl7scj[Queue Names] section for more information. Overrides the queue name set in the Global element. Optional.
|*userName* |The name of the user that's used to impersonate the call when accessing MSMQ from the Gateway. Overrides the user name set in the Global element. Optional.
|*password* |The password of the user that's used to impersonate the call when accessing MSMQ from the Gateway. Overrides the password set in the Global element. Optional.
|*messageFormatter* |The message formatter to be used in MSMQ for serializing and deserializing the message. Optional.
|*payload* |The message payload to be sent to the Gateway. Optional
|===

== Queue Names (Public, Private, and Clustered)

The MSMQ connector supports private and public queues. Private queues are queues that are not published in Active Directory and are displayed only on the local computer that contains them.  

The following schemes are supported:

* Path name: `ComputerName\private$\QueueName`  
* Path name on local computer: `\private$\QueueName`  
* Direct format name: `DIRECT=ComputerAddress\PRIVATE$\PrivateQueueName`  
* Private format name: `PRIVATE=ComputerGUID\QueueNumber`

Public queues are queues that are published in Active Directory.  

Public format names contain the string `PUBLIC=` followed by the identifier assigned to the queue when it was created. This identifier is the GUID listed for the queue object in the Active Directory.  

The following is the general format used to reference a public queue and its associated queue journal:

* `PUBLIC=QueueGUID`  
* `PUBLIC=QueueGUID;JOURNAL`  

The connector also supports private queues hosted in a failover cluster or also known as an MSMQ cluster. The queues are private to the cluster and referenced with the following format:

`ClusterName\private$\QueueName`

== Supported Message Properties

The connector allows passing or receiving properties to and from the MSMQ message. Those properties are set in the current Mule Message and passed to the Windows Gateway as custom HTTP headers. The following message illustrates how the connector creates a new MSMQ message with a value “CustomLabel” for the label property:

[source, code, linenums]
----
POST: https://localhost:9333/msmq
Authorization: mule test-token
Mule-Msmq-Queue-Name: .\private$\qout

== MSMQ Connector Troubleshooting

The MSMQ connector is integrated with the Mule ESB logging infrastructure for logging errors and relevant information for the user.

The following table lists common errors that can occur while using the MSMQ connector:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Error* |*Cause*
|Unauthorized. "Authentication with the proxy failed". |The security token configured on the connector and the one on the gateway do not match. Verify the token configured on the MSMQ connector within Mule and in the Windows Gateway service configuration file.
|Forbidden. "Access Forbidden to write in queue [Queue Name]" |The user with the credentials specified in username and password does not have permissions for writing to or reading the queue. Verify the queue access permissions.
|Not Acceptable. "The connector and proxy versions do not match" |This is unlikely to happen. The version of the connector running in the ESB is not compatible with the version of the Windows Gateway. Make sure to update the connector or gateway to use the same version.
|Not Found. Queue Not Found [Queue Name] |The queue configured in the connector could not be found.
|Not Found. |The Gateway address and port configured in the connector are incorrect. Verify the Gateway configuration to determine the right server name and port.
|Internal Server Error |An unexpected error occurred in the Gateway. Check the Gateway traces to determine the cause of this issue.

. Double-click *Choice* flow control under the *msmq-choice-flow* flow to view its properties:
+
image:MSMQAdmin.png[MSMQAdmin] 
The Choice flow control evaluates the `msmq.acknowledgement` property of each message received. This routes messages to a SubFlow (using Flow Reference control). Messages received in `adminq` are just for acknowledgement purposes. Even when those six messages have an `msmq.id` property, it is not important, but what is relevant is the `msmq.correlation.id`, which points to the `msmq.id` of the message originating the acknowledgement message in the administrative queue. In the sample, Message 4 has been set with a millisecond in the property timeToBeReceived, which produces a ReceiveTimeout NACK. Also Message 6 is sent in a transactional way using a non-transactional queue, which brings a NotTransactionalQueue NACK.

==== Deleting a Message

. Open the Message Queuing Administrative Console. 
. Press the Windows Key + *E*. 
. Right-click *Computer* and click *Manage*.
+
image:MSMQManage.png[MSMQManage] 

. In the Computer Management Console tree on the left, open *Services and Applications* > *Message Queueing* > *Private Queues* 
. A remaining message displays in secondq, as MSMQ connector in not configured to listen this queue. 
. Delete the message: In the left tree, open *Private Queues* > *secondq* > *Queue messages* and right-click *Queue messages* > *All Tasks* > *Purge*:
+
image:MSMQpurge.png[MSMQpurge]
