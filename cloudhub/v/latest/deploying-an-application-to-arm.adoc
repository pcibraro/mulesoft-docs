= Deploying an Application to ARM
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, deploy, manage, arm, runtime manager

There are two ways you can deploy a Mule application to the Anypoint Runtime Manager (ARM):

* Through the *Anypoint Platform* - Log in to the Anypoint Platform (either the online or the on premises edition), select the *Runtime Manager* section. Then, in the *Applcations* tab, click the *Deploy application* button.
* From *Anypoint Studio* - Once you have built out your application as a mule project, right-click on your project on the package explorer, then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform*. 


== Deploying an Application Through the Anypoint Platform

To deploy an application:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] or click *Sign up* on the sign on page.
. Select the *Runtime Manager*:

+
[NOTE]
If you wish to deploy your application to a server on premises, you must first register it to ARM. To do this, see link:/cloudhub/managing-servers-on-premises[Managing Servers On Premises.]
+
.  You must then instruct information about the deployment, explained in a section below.

== Deploy to ARM from Anypoint Studio

You can easily deploy your applications to the Runtime Manager, straight from Anypoint Studio. This is specially helpful if you're still developing the application and want to deploy it often to an online test environment. To do this, left click on the application in the package explorer, select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform*.

. If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Your credentials are then  stored and used automatically next time you deploy to the Anypoint Platform. You can manage these credentials through the Studio preferences menu, in *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*.

== Deployment Settings

When deploying through the Anypoint Platform or Anypoint Studio, you're presented with the same set of fields to fill, these are explained below.


=== Deployment Target

ARM lets you specify where you want to deploy your application:

* On the CloudHub worker cloud
* On an on-premises server, server group, or cluster

From the drop-down list, click *CloudHub*, a server name, or a server group for where you want to deploy your application. Deploying to CloudHub implies deploying to the cloud, whereas by selecting a server or group you're deploying an application to one or more servers in your organization's data center.

[NOTE]
You might not see this option if you haven't registered any of your servers to your Anypoint Platform account. To do so, see link:/cloudhub/managing-servers-on-premises[Managing Servers On Premises].

If you select *CloudHub*, you're then able to also supply:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Tab |Values
|*Runtime* |Runtime version, worker size, workers, region, and restart options
|*Properties* |Key value pairs
|*Insight* |link:/cloudhub/runtime-manager-insight[Insight] values for metadata and replay
|*Logging* |Log level and categories to include in logs
|===


=== Application Name

[NOTE]
This in not required for applications deployed to servers on premises.

Every application that's deployed to CloudHub requires a unique application domain name. The application domain identifies your application in CloudHub and also provides you with a public URL, `http://myapplicationdomain.cloudhub.io`, for accessing the application if it exposes any inbound endpoints.

In the *Deploy Application* dialog, enter a unique application name. The Application Name also becomes the cloudhub.io domain name that you use to access your application; for example the Application Name, abcde is accessible at *http://abcde.cloudhub.io*. Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 40 characters. If the name is valid, CloudHub alerts you whether it is available or already reserved by another user.

image:DeployAppName.png[DeployAppName]

=== Application File

Upload a new file for deployment. Click the **Choose file **button, select your application file, and then click *Open*. You can also click the *Get from sandbox* button to copy a file from a non-production environment into your current environment. (If the Get From Sandbox button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production environment to view this option.) 

image:ApplicationFile.png[ApplicationFile]

[NOTE]
If you're deploying from Anypoint Studio, you can't modify the default value of this option. It will be the file that corresponds to the Studio project over which you selected the option *Deploy to Anypoint Platform*.

=== Runtime Version

Using the drop-down menu, select the *Runtime version* to which you to deploy:

image:RuntimeVersion2.png[RuntimeVersion2]

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that the runtime version is the same Mule version used to develop your application. For example, if you use the value 3.5.1 and your application uses the new HTTP connector introduced in Mule 3.6 and newer, your application won't deploy and the log will contain errors.
* To see what runtime version was set on an aplication that was already deployed, select the *Applications* tab and click your application. In the expansion view on the right, click *Manage Application*. Click *Settings* to see the deployment values.
====

=== Worker Sizing

[NOTE]
This in not required for applications deployed to servers on premises.

You can allocate an amount and a size for the *Worker size* of your application on CloudHub. On each application, workers are responsible for executing your application logic.

In CloudHub there are 5 different worker sizes to choose from, with the compute and memory capacities described in the following table:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Worker Sizes* |0.1 vCores +
 500 MB Mem |0.2 vCores +
 1 GB Mem |1 vCores +
 1.5 GB Mem |2 vCores +
 3.5 GB Mem |4 vCores +
 7.5 GB Mem
|===

Workers that have less than 1 vCore capacity (0.1 vCores and 0.2 vCores)  offer limited CPU and IO for smaller work loads. They are intended for use in test applications or applications that run intermittently and have limited compute capacity requirements, not for long running production applications with significant compute capacity requirements.

Each worker has 8 GB of storage, which is used for both system and application storage. Applications with greater storage needs (verbose logging etc.) should use one of the larger worker sizes - 2 vCores or 4 vCores, which have additional storage as follows:

* 2 vCores workers have an additional 32 GB of SSD storage mounted on /tmp
* 4 vCores workers have an additional 80 GB of storage, mounted as two volumes on /tmp (40 GB), and /opt/storage (40 GB)

[IMPORTANT]
The workers with additional storage as listed above are only available for Mule runtimes 3.6.2 or later, or API Gateway 2.0.2 or later.

To select the worker size and amount of each, select options from the drop-down menu to configure the computing power you need:

image:WorkerSizeAndQty.png[WorkerSizeAndQty]

Depending on how many vCores your account possesses, some of these options may not be eligible, as you may not have enough available capacity.

[IMPORTANT]
If you select more vCores than are available in your account, CloudHub allows you to create the application using the console, but you cannot start your application until vCores are available.

When deploying an application with more than one worker, CloudHub automatically load-balances any incoming traffic across your allocated workers. For more information, see link:/cloudhub/fabric[Fabric].

=== Region

[NOTE]
This in not required for applications deployed to servers on premises.

If you have global deployment enabled on your account, you can change the *Region* to which your application deploys using the drop-down menu. Administrators can link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-cloudhub-specific-settings[set the default region] on the Organization tab in Account Settings, but that region can be adjusted here when the application is deployed, if necessary.

* Note that applications deployed to Europe automatically have their domain updated to  `http://myapplicationdomain.eu.cloudhub.io`. 
* Note that applications deployed to Australia automatically have their domain updated to `http://myapplicationdomain.au.cloudhub.io.`

=== Secure Data Gateway

Click the Secure data gateway chckbox if your application has a link:/cloudhub/secure-data-gateway[secure data gateway] attached to it.

=== Persistent Queues

[NOTE]
This in not available on applications deployed to servers on premises.

Check this box to enable persistent queues on your application. Persistent queues protect against message loss and allow you to distribute workloads across a set of workers. Before you can take advantage of persistent queueing, your application needs to be set up to use queues. See link:/cloudhub/fabric[Fabric]  for more information.

=== Automatic Restart

If you are deploying to a runtime that supports worker monitoring (3.4.0 runtime or later), you have the option to check *Automatically restart application when not responding*. With this box checked, CloudHub automatically restarts your application when the monitoring system discovers a problem with your application. If this box is not checked, CloudHub produces all the log messages, notifications, and any configured alerts, but takes no action to restart the application. 

Read more about worker monitoring.

=== Properties Tab

[NOTE]
This in not available on applications deployed to servers on premises.

You can also optionally specify properties that your application requires. This allows you to externalize important pieces of configuration which may switch depending on the environment in which you're deploying. For example, if you're using a Mule application locally, you might configure your database host to be localhost. But if you're using CloudHub, you might configure it to be an Amazon RDS server.

To create an application property, click the *Properties* tab and set the variable by either using a text `key=value` format or by using the list format with two text boxes. After you've made the change, click  *Apply Changes* . 

image:PropertiesTab.png[PropertiesTab]

These application properties can be used inside your Mule configuration. For example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource" destroy-method="shutdown">
   <spring:property name="driverName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
   <spring:property name="url"value="${database.url}"/>
</spring:bean>
----

If you also have the same properties set in a mule-app.properties file inside your application, the application property settings in CloudHub override mule-app.properties when your application is deployed.

Note that you can flag application properties as secure so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console. See link:/cloudhub/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties] for more information.

=== Insight Tab

[NOTE]
This in not available on applications deployed to servers on premises.

The Insight tab lets you specify metadata options for the Insight analytics feature. For more information, see the link:/cloudhub/runtime-manager-insight[Insight] document.

image:CHInsightTab.png[CHInsightTab]

=== Logging Tab

[NOTE]
This in not available on applications deployed to servers on premises.

The Logging tab lets you change the logging setting (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, or ERROR). For more information, see link:/cloudhub/logs[Working with Logs].

image:CHLoggingTab.png[CHLoggingTab]


=== Setting up Alerts

The bell icon in the upper right corner lets you manage notifications. For more information, see link:/cloudhub/alerts-and-notifications[Managing Notifications].

== Completing the Process

After you complete the settings described above, click *Deploy Application* and ARM automatically begins the deployment process. If you're deploying to the cloud, it first uploads it. During this process, your view is switched to the log view allowing you to monitor the process of your application deployment. This process could take several minutes. During the deployment, the application status indicator changes to yellow to indicate deployment in progress.

When deployment is complete, the application status indicator changes to green and you are notified in the status area that the application has deployed successfully.


For the case of CloudHub applications, the following gets recorded on the logs:

[source, code, linenums]
----
Successfully deployed [mule application name]
----

== Configuring a Deployed Application

. In the Applications tab, click an application entry and select *Manage Application*:

== Automatically Deploying a Proxy from the Anypoint Platform for APIs

If you've registered an API in the Anypoint Platform, you can easily run it through an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy[
auto generated proxy] to track its usage and implement link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[policies]. You can deploy this proxy to the Runtime Manager without ever needing to go into the Runtime Manager section of the Anypoint platform. From a menu in the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-api-versions[API version page], you can trigger the deployment of your proxy and set up the name it will have when deployed, the Gateway version to use and the CloudHub environment when deploying to the cloud. Then, you can optionally access the Runtime Manager deployment menu for this proxy and configure advanced settings. link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[Read More].

== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to red. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. If you're deploying to CloudHub, you can check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.

== See Also

* You can also deploy applications directly from link:/cloudhub/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Anypoint Studio] or the link:/cloudhub/command-line-tools[Command Line Tools]. A complete set of link:/cloudhub/cloudhub-api[REST APIs] are also available for deployment.
* link:/cloudhub/managing-applications-on-arm[Managing Applications on ARM] contains more information on how to manage your CloudHub application, make changes, scale workers, and perform other application management tasks.
