An application is a Mule Project that runs on a Mule or an API Gateway instance. The instance can be running on a server (or group of servers) on premises, or in the cloud. Servers and server groups must first be registered on the Runtime Manager to be eligible for deploying an app to them, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers-on-premises[Managing Servers On Premises] for more information.

From the *Applications* tab you can perform the following tasks when you click on an instance:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Start, Stop, or Delete an Application>>
* <<Manage an Application>>


== Deploy an Application

When you deploy an application, you set it to run in CloudHub, or in a server or server group on premises.

You can create this application using Anypoint Studio, which is a great help, but you could also create it with any editor.
Once you have built it, there are two ways you can deploy a Mule application to the Anypoint Runtime Manager (ARM):

* Through the *Anypoint Platform* - Log in to the Anypoint Platform (either the online or the on premises edition), select the *Runtime Manager* section. Then, in the *Applcations* tab, click the *Deploy application* button.
* From *Anypoint Studio* - Once you have built out your application as a mule project, right-click on your project on the package explorer, then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform*. 


== Start, Stop, or Delete an Application

To start, stop, or delete an application, click an application, then open the dropdown menu:

Select *Start*, *Stop*, or *Delete* as needed. The *Start* command restarts stopped applications, and if the application is Undeployed, sends the application's zip file to the server to start the application on the server.

== Manage an Application

Managing an application lets you view a dashboard that lists Mule Messages, CPU use, memory use, and any of the categories of commands in the left navigation area, such as viewing logs, alerts, queues, change settings, debugging, and more.

To manage an application, click *Manage Application*:

You will see a dashboard like the one below:
